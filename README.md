About the Dataset
The Titanic dataset is one of the most iconic datasets in data science and machine learning. It contains detailed information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912 after hitting an iceberg. The dataset is often used for classification problems, particularly predicting whether a passenger survived the disaster based on certain features.

This dataset includes variables such as:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger

Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)

Name: Full name of the passenger

Sex: Gender

Age: Age in years

SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard

Parch: Number of parents or children aboard

Ticket: Ticket number

Fare: Amount paid for the ticket

Cabin: Cabin number (if available)

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)

The Titanic dataset offers rich potential for uncovering insights related to demographics, socioeconomic status, and survival rates. For instance, one might investigate whether gender, age, or ticket class had a significant impact on survival. These insights are especially useful for practicing data wrangling, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques.

In this analysis, we'll be conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset to better understand the structure of the data, spot patterns, and identify meaningful relationships that may influence survival outcomes.
